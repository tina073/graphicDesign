What it means to be a Pennsylvania College Republican
At a time when Democrats control the Presidency and have historic majorities in both houses of Congress, it is important to have a loud opposition voice to hold the Left accountable. As College Republicans we believe that it is the youth who will lead the revival of the conservative movement, providing the power to Republican candidates as we attempt to reverse the course of the previous two elections. We will also strive to help educate our peers in an attempt to present a conservative viewpoint that is far too often lacking on many college campuses. Collectively we will be the backbone to the Republican resurgence in 2009 and beyond.
