	<p>A Painting Tip</p>
	<p>If you're painting with latex paints, and the job is going to take more than a day (or you just need a longish break), putting used brushes and rollers in <br />
	the refrigerator prevents them from drying out - and more importantly, prevents you from having to clean the brushes until you're done with the job for good.</p>
	<p>I hate cleaning brushes, so this tip is a life saver. Just put the brushes in a plastic bag (I prefer the recyclable grocery bag variety) and pop it in the veggie drawer or wherever. I find allotting certain sections of the refrigerator for different paint types helpful. And you may as well.</p>
	<p>When you need them again, they'll be ready to go. Who would've thought you'd get such great home improvement advice here? Then again, maybe you haven't.</p>
